# Smart Daily Assistant

A compact local personal assistant desktop app built with Python + Tkinter. It includes Tasks, Habits, a Pomodoro Timer, Quick Notes, and simple reminders. Data is stored locally in JSON files under `storage/`.

## How to run
1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   - `python -m venv venv`
   - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
2. Install dependencies:
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the app:
   - `python main.py`

The app will create a `storage/` directory with initial JSON files on first run
